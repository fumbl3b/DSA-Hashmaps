## Hash Maps

1. [see HashMap.js and HashMaps_drills.js]
2. this will create two HashMap() instances, first with the value 20 and second 10.  Each first starts with a different value, then overwrites it for some reason.
3. a. Show your hash map after the insertion of keys 10, 22, 31, 4, 15, 28, 17, 88, 59 into a hash map of length 11 using open addressing and a hash function k mod m, where k is the key and m is the length.
